# Homework 2: ER Diagram Designs

## Overview

This repository contains my Homework 2 deliverables, which include Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram designs in both **Chen (Graphviz)** and **Crow’s Foot (Mermaid)** notations for selected systems. The project demonstrates my ability to analyze system requirements and translate them into well-structured database designs.

The systems covered in this project are:

- **Library Management System**
- **Restaurant Reservation System**
- **School Course Enrollment System**

Each system section in the report includes:
- A system overview with key entities, attributes, and relationships.
- ER diagrams using both Chen and Crow’s Foot notations.
- A detailed list of relation set schemas.
- A discussion of design choices, including the use of associative entities, simple attributes, and cardinality.

## Repository Structure

- **report.qmd**  
  The main Quarto document containing the complete report. This file includes system overviews, ER diagrams, relation set schemas, and design discussions.

- **README.md**  
  This file, which provides an overview of the project and setup instructions.

- **images/**  
  A directory for storing individual diagram source files if needed.

- **output/**  
  The folder where the rendered HTML or PDF report is saved after you run the Quarto render command.
